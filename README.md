React
JS library that helps build interactive UI
React is Java Script library with a model-view-controller architecture that uses components to build applications faster.
It's not a framework, React does have a dedicated framework called Create React App that can be used to build web applications.
Commands to create React app :
npx create-react-app mywebapp
OR
npm create-react-app mywebapp
Everything in <div id="root"></div> will be displayed in the browser.-->this is the container for our application
There are two types of React Component :
1.) Functional Component
2.) Class Component
The react components must return a JSX object.

To send data from parent(outer) component [[i.e App.js]] to child(inner) component
