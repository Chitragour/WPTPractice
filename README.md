REACT
> React is a JS library that helps build interactive UI.
> React is Java Script library with a model-view-controller architecture that uses components to build applications faster.
> It's not a framework, React does have a dedicated framework called Create React App that can be used to build web applications.
> React builds a JavaScript data structure called "Virtual DOM"
> React uses ReactDOM library to render component tree on the web
> React uses React Native library to render component tree on mobile app
> Thus, react is platform agnostic and we can use it for building apps for web,mobile and desktop devices
> In contrast to React we have other tools like Angular and View which are Frameworks.
> DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIBRARY AND FRAMEWORK
> Framework is a tool set i.e. it provides a set of tools for building apps.
> Library is a tool that provides specific functionality.
> Commands to create React app :
 npx create-react-app mywebapp
          OR
npm create-react-app mywebapp

> Everything in <div id="root"></div> will be displayed in the browser.-->this is the container for our application.

>There are two types of React Component :
1.) Functional Component
2.) Class Component

> App.js is a functional component that returns a JSX , for multiple JSX objects we need to wrap it inside a tag.
> In JSX we use {} to render data dynamically , this is also called Interpolation.
> The react components must return a JSX object. (You cannot return multiple elements from a single component) So we write all inside a <div> or some other element.
> <> </> are Fragment tags used to wrap multiple elements.

> To send data from parent(outer) component [[i.e App.js]] to child(inner) component -> we use PROPS
> The components we create collect these PROPS.
> We can pass all data types to PROPS
> In React each element has a propert or PROP called "onClick"
> 


JAVASCRIPT
> JS supported data types :
1.)Number
2.)boolean
3.)string
4.)undefined
5.)function
