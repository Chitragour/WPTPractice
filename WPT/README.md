# WHAT IS REACT?<br/>
React is a JavaScript Library, used to build interactive user interfaces. It allows you to create complex user interfaces by breaking down the code in small pieces known as components.<br/>

# WHAT ARE THE ADVANTAGES OF USING REACT? <br/>
REUSABILITY: You can reuse the components wherever required without writing them from scratch. </br>
COMMUNITY SUPPORT: It haves a large community, so getting help whenever required is easy here.  </br>
PERFORMANCE: Rendering of components is faster as it follows asynchronous programming.  </br>

# WHAT ARE THE LIMITATIONS OF REACT? </br>
